- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
Association makes the program easier to digest for me cause I know that even though I'm doing all these classes seperatley in the end they still relate to each other.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What didnt work was thinking that if I spent a long time on a specific part sooner or later I would get it. But what did work was skipping the parts I had difficulty in and focused on the ones I knew I could do. An advice I would give is make sure to first do the tasks you can do to at least get as many points as you can.
